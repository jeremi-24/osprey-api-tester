## Call for Contributors

Osprey API Tester is an open-source VSCode extension that generates and tests API requests directly from backend controllers (NestJS for now).

We are looking for contributors to help with:
- Performance optimization (AST, ts-morph)
- Support for Java Spring Boot
- Bug fixes & testing

### Known Performance Issues
- Reading for example 39 controllers in a project can take **3–4 minutes**.
- Opening the Request Panel from the Activity Bar can take **30s to 1 minute**.

Beginner-friendly issues will be labeled.

### How to contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Pick an issue or propose one
3. Open a PR

All contributors are welcome.
